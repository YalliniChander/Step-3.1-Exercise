# Machine Learning Algorithm Comparison

This repository contains a Python script that trains and evaluates different machine learning algorithms using the Iris dataset. The algorithms compared are:

- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
